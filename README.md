# Homoglyph toolset for [Raku](https://www.raku.org) language

[Homoglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph) is set of one or more graphemes that has identical or very similar look to some other set of graphemes.
For example:

 * `6` (DIGIT SIX) and `б` (CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER BE)
 * `w` (LATIN SMALL LETTER W) and `ω` (GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA)
 * `oo` (2 x LATIN SMALL LETTER O) and `က` (MYANMAR LETTER KA)
 * `E` (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E) and `Ε` (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON) and `Е` (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER IE)
 * `V` (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V) and `\/` (REVERSE SOLIDUS + SOLIDUS)

Homoglyphs are funny and dangerous at the same time.
